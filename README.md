# IS4242_Group3_Engery_Usage_Prediction

This project is to build prediction models to accurately predict energy usage of different states in the US to help energy production companies to be more cost-effective while generating energy. 

## Description

In this project, we created our own dataset about energy consumption across states in the US with other relevant features such as transportation, weather, population and disaster. We experimented with different ML models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to find the best one for our own dataset in predicting energy consumption. This intellegient system can help engery production companies to estimate energy demand more accurately and sole their problem of overproduction or underproduction.
